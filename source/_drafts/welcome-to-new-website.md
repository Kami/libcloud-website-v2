Today we are pleased to announce a new, improved and more user friendly version
of our website.

### Background and History

Original website was first developed and published back in 2009 when the
project joined Apache Incubator.

A lot has changed since 2009 and during that time the web has been evolving at
a rapid pace. Now we have terms such as [responsive web design][2], great
front-end frameworks for building responsive websites such as [Bootstrap][2]
and [Zurb][3] and many other new things which didn't exist back when we first
launched.

During this time we focused most of our efforts on improving the code and
making the library better. This meant the website didn't receive a lot of
needed love and attention so look-wise, it was mostly stuck in the 2009 era.

Over the years it has also become apparent that presentation and documentation
is also equally or even more important then the code itself so we have decided
to "fix" some of the "mistakes" we have made in the past.

A couple of months back we have launched a [new documentation][4] and today
we are happy to present you a new website which was built with modern tools and
principles in mind.

### Improvements and new features

</div>

New website features many improvements and new features. Some of the more
important ones are listed bellow.

#### More modern and user-friendly design

New website now features a more modern and user-friendly design (bigger fonts,
better typography, etc.).

On top of that, the new design is fully responsive which means you can now
better enjoy the content on smaller devices such ad mobile phones and tablets.

#### Blog section

New website now features a fully-fledged blog.

We will use the blog to post important project news and announcement and keep
you up to date with what is currently going on.

For all the people who still use RSS readers to stay up to date, we now also
offer an [ATOM feed][10].

#### Updated credits page

[Credits][9] page now features an up to date list of people who have
contributed code or documentation.

As noted on that page, the list is automatically generated from the CHANGES
file so it might not be 100% accurate.

### Under the Hood

Old website was powered by [Apache CMS][6]. It mostly worked good enough for
simple use cases, but it had a small user base which meant it was lacking
plugin and modifications ecosystems offered by many other popular content
management systems.

Because of that, we have decided to switch to [Jekyll][7], a Ruby based static
website and blogging engine.

On top of that, the new website is fully responsive and built using
[Bootstrap 3][2] framework.

Source code of the new website can be found in the [SVN repository][8].

### Conclusion

We hope you will like and enjoy the new website.

We also hope the new website now better reflects the underlying evolution of
the library and the direction we are heading.

If you have any suggestions on how we can make the website even better, don't
hesitate and share it with us. You can send your feedback to the
[mailing list][11], or you can [checkout the website repository][12] and make
the changes yourself.
