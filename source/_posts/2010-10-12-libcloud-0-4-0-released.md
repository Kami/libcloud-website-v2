the popular cloud server providers. It was created to make it easy for
developers to build products that work between any of the services that it
supports.

Major changes since the previous release:

* Removed dependency on Zope.Interface.
* New driver for ElasticHosts.
* Bug fixes and improvements for GoGrid, EC2, Linode, Slicehost, and
  RimuHosting.
