Hi all,

I just wanted to let everyone know that the Libcloud PMC has decided to
invite a new committer - Hutson Betts (hbetts).

He has previously mostly contributed to the OpenNebula driver and the
networking API.

We believe that granting him the committer status will allow him to more
easily and directly contribute to the project.

Please help us welcome him!
