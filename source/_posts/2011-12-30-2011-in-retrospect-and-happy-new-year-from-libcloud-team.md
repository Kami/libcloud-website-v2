Dear users & developers,

First of all, Libcloud team wishes everyone a Happy New Year 2012!

2011 has been a great year for us and we have accomplished a lot of things:

* Website has been ported to the Apache CMS and updated with a lot of new
content, including documentation
* In May we have graduated from the incubator to a top level project
* Two new committers have joined the team (Tomaz Muraus, Hutson Betts)
* We have grown from supporting a single API (cloud servers) to supporting
four different APIs (cloud servers, load balancers, cloud storage, dns)
* We have introduced support for Python 3
* We have released a total of 7 new versions
* We have received many patches by external contributors
* We have held two development sprints (PyCon, EuroPython)
* Code wise we have grown from ~4300 LOC to ~14300 LOC (excluding tests)

Lets try to make 2012 even better :)
