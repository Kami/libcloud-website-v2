Hello all,

Due to recent graduation (woho!), all the SVN repositories have been moved
and the mailing list addresses have also been changed.

If you are already subscribed to one of the old mailing list addresses your
subscription was automatically transfered to the new one so you don't need
to do anything on your part.

New addresses can be found bellow.

**SVN repositories**

* Main code repository: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/libcloud/
* Website repository:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/libcloud

**Mailing lists addresses**

* dev@libcloud.apache.org (was libcloud@incubator.apache.org)
* commits@libcloud.apache.org from (was
libcloud-commits@incubator.apache.org)
* private@libcloud.apache.org from (was
libcloud-private@incubator.apache.org)

* users@libcloud.apache.org - this is a new users mailing list for a general
talk about Libcloud and other off-topic things
* security@libcloud.apache.org - new private mailing list used for reporting
security vulnerabilities

## Note to the committers

CMS part of the website hasn't been fully migrated yet. In the mean time,
please try to avoid editing raw HTML files, because this means we will need
to manually edit markdown files again when the CMS stuff is migrated.
