In addition to our existing users (**users@libcloud.apache.org**), developers
(**dev@libcloud.apache.org**) and commits (**commits@libcloud.apache.org**)
mailing list, we now also have a new very low volume announce mailing list -
**announce@libcloud.apache.org**.

The mailing list is moderated and will only be used for distributing important
project announcements such as information about new releases and other
important project updates.

You can subscribe to it by sending an email to
