# {{ page.title }}

Google Summer of Code is a program where Google sponsors students from around
the world to spend their summer working on open-source projects. Student is
paid 5000$ if they successfully complete all of their evaluations. More
information about the program can be found on the [project website][5].

## Accepted Projects

### Libcloud REST

HTTP interface for Libcloud (http://libcloud.apache.org/) which exposes
all the Libcloud functionality through a RESTful API. Currently Libcloud
has a big limitation - you can only use it with Python. Adding a REST
interface would allow users to leverage Libcloud functionality through an
arbitrary language which knows how to talk HTTP.

**Mentor**: Tomaz Muraus
**Student**: Ilgiz Islamgulov

Project progress can be tracked on [Github][3] and weekly updates are sent to
the mailing list.
